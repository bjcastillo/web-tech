Differentiate the following CSS selectors (20 pts)
a. Combining selectors
b. Class and ID selectors
c. Pseudo-classes

Answer:
Selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. 
Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
When designing a web page, you will want certain styles to apply to specific elements on the page. 
For instance, you may want to set the text color of all <p> tags to green or change the font size of a header.
Selectors allow you to target specific elements on a web page that you can apply styles to. 
There are many selectors available, such as universal selectors, descendant selectors, child selectors, and grouping selectors.

Class selectors are defined using a "." symbol.
It allows you to define style rules that apply to any element with a class attribute equal to a certain value.
Classes, can be used across multiple elements. 
So, if you apply a style using a class selector, any element which shares that class will be subject to the styles you define.

ID selectors are defined using a # symbol.
The id selector allows you to define style rules that apply to a single element on the web page. 
Each web page can only have one element with a single ID attribute. 
This means the ID selector can never be used to style more than one element. 
They are immediately followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to.

Pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. 
A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS.
Pseudo-classes can stylize elements differently when users are hovering over them (:hover) 
or at that exact moment when users are selecting a link (:active). 
It can also stylize links differently after users have visited them (:visited).
